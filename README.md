# Chrome extension to mark scroll level on pages

I was reading yet another blog online and while its nice to bookmark things
I'd really like to have a custom way to save where I was exactly on the page

## Things this plugin does

- [ ] Save scroll level on page load
- [ ] Save scroll level on page unload
- [ ] Save scroll level on page refresh
- [ ] Save scroll level on page scroll
- [ ] Save scroll level on page resize
- [ ] Save scroll level on page focus
- [ ] Save scroll level on page blur
- [ ] Save scroll level on page visibility change
- [ ] Save scroll level on page visibility timeout
- [ ] Tag pages with scroll level

## Updates

- [ ] No more overlay, everything is going to be contained in the popup, similar to dark reader

## Future addtions

- [ ] Converted Javascript to Typescript
